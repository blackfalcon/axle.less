			<h5>Axle.LESS, the missing OOCSS guide</h5>
			<p>I am sure many of you out there are asking how you would actually use this in your process and application development. Axle is only a tool in a larger process.  </p>
			<p>At this time, I am speaking with many development groups in the Madison and Milwaukee area as to how I came up with Axle and how you can use it's awesome in your projects.  In the coming days, I will do my best to get some instructions in this site.</p>
			<p>While you are waiting, I would encourage you to stop by my blog <a href="http://blog.mbreo.com">@blog.mbreo.com</a> and follow along <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/anotheruiguy">@anotheruiguy</a>.</p>
