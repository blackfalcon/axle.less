			<h5>Well, not at this time at least</h5>
			<p>Here's the deal.  Axle is in rapid development at this time.  There are really cool things that I want to accomplish and get to a 1.0 version. And to be frank, having to build awesome and then engineer all these fallbacks just to satisfy the shortcomings of IE is not something that I have time for right now.</p>
			<p>And in the end, I think I will only be supporting IE9.  IE8, maybe.  </p>
			<p>But personally, I am becoming a strong believer in the idea that you get the web experience you signup for when you use a browser. The days of heroic measures to 'update' browsers that do not support modern experiences are numberd.</p>
			<p>Once I have a 1.0 version, I will get to adding IE spuurt, but till then, I encourage you stop by my blog <a href="http://blog.mbreo.com">@blog.mbreo.com</a> and follow along <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/anotheruiguy">@anotheruiguy</a>.</p>
