Compiled core.css goes in this directory

The core.less file is a series of @imports of the other .LESS files.  At the point whereas the .LESS compiler magically exports the one CSS file to rule them all, you should designate this directory.  It is this CSS file that is used to render the UI of the site.

There are a couple of ways to compile .LESS.  There is a client side .JS (which I don't like at all) and then there is a server side version (haven't tried that, don't have the foo power for that install).

Happy coding ;)
